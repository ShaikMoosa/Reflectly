## Current Implementation Details

### Landing Page

The landing page is implemented using Next.js with the following sections:
- Hero section with parallax effect
- Features with animated cards
- Testimonial carousel
- Pricing comparison cards
- FAQ accordion

### Subscription System

The subscription system has the following components:
- Database tables: `user_subscriptions` and `user_usage`
- Lemon Squeezy webhook handler for processing subscription events
- Helper functions for checking subscription status and limits
- Feature limitations based on plan:
  - Free: 5 video transcriptions, 5 AI chat queries
  - Premium: 50 video transcriptions, 1000 AI chat sessions

### User Flow

1. User visits landing page
2. User selects a plan (Free or Premium)
3. Premium users go through Lemon Squeezy checkout
4. After payment, user creates account
5. User gets access to features based on their plan
6. Usage is tracked and limited based on plan
