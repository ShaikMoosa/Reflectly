# Product Context

## Purpose
Reflectly addresses the gap between raw audio content and actionable knowledge. In an era where information is captured in meetings, lectures, and spoken conversations, Reflectly transforms this audio content into structured, searchable text that can be organized, analyzed, and enhanced through AI interaction.

The application serves as a comprehensive note-taking and knowledge management system with advanced transcription capabilities and AI-powered insights, helping users capture, organize, and leverage information more effectively.
