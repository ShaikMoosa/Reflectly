# Subscription System Testing Notes

## Current Status

We have established the testing infrastructure for the subscription system with:

- A basic Jest configuration that supports JavaScript tests
- Test setup with mocks for Next.js components
- Basic test scripts for running subscription-specific tests
- Test coverage measurement

## Test Organization

Our tests are organized following the project structure:

```
app/__tests__/
├── subscription-api.test.js         # API endpoint tests
├── subscription-repository.test.js  # Repository tests
├── subscription-test-demo.test.js   # Simple demo test
```

## Implemented Tests

We have implemented the following tests:

1. **API Tests**
   - Basic subscription API test with 3 test cases:
     - Authentication check
     - Redirect to checkout
     - Error handling

2. **Repository Tests**
   - SubscriptionRepository test with 5 test cases:
     - Getting subscription by user ID
     - Handling missing subscriptions
     - Getting subscription status
     - Updating subscription

3. **Demo Test**
   - Simple mathematical test to verify Jest setup

## Known Issues

We encountered and resolved several issues with the testing setup:

1. **Jest Configuration**: Had to ensure jest.setup.js uses CommonJS format instead of ES modules
2. **DOM References**: Had to avoid direct DOM manipulation in mocks
3. **TypeScript Support**: Currently using JavaScript for tests instead of TypeScript due to configuration challenges

## Next Steps

To complete the testing implementation, the following steps are needed:

1. **Fix TypeScript Tests**:
   - Update tsconfig.json to support Jest with TypeScript
   - Convert existing JavaScript tests to TypeScript once the configuration issues are resolved

2. **Expand Test Coverage**:
   - Add tests for subscription cancellation endpoint
   - Add tests for subscription checkout URL endpoint
   - Add tests for subscription usage tracking
   - Add component tests for subscription UI
   - Add integration tests for full subscription flows

3. **CI Integration**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions to run tests automatically
   - Configure test coverage reporting

## Command Reference

Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run subscription tests only:
```bash
npm run test:subscription
```

Or directly with Jest:
```bash
npx jest app/__tests__/subscription
```

Run test coverage analysis:
```bash
npm run test:subscription:coverage
```

## Conclusion

The subscription system testing framework is now in place with working examples of API tests and repository tests. We've successfully set up the testing infrastructure and have a path forward to implement more comprehensive tests. The next steps would be to expand the test coverage and convert the tests to TypeScript once the configuration issues are resolved.
